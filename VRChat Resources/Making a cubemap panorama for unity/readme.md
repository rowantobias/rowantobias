Hi. this guide follows a similar setup for skyboxes in CS source/similar (since that was the only tutorial i could even *find* for cubemaps...). nevertheless this should help with making skyboxes for vrchat worlds (or unity worlds in general, i suppose...).
-INSTRUCTIONS-
1. Open skyboxsetup.blend
2. Assign texture to sphere in the node/material settings
3. Select camera
4. Rotate camera via object settings panel with the given values on panorama.png, render, and save to an output folder
5. Stitch together all renders to match the layout of panorama.png

It is a little overcomplicated but it works! Lol!
